- **Location owners** monetize their physical spaces through digital advertising rights

## 🎯 Core Features

## 🏗️ Architecture

## 💡 Real-World Inspiration

Similar to how **Pokémon GO** demonstrated the power of location-based AR engagement, our platform leverages this concept for advertising. Projects like **ARCONA** are building AR metaverses with digital land ownership, providing a blueprint for spatial advertising opportunities.
